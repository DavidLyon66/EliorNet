# EliorNet: Symbolic Signal Protocol for Medical & Wellness Use

EliorNet is a symbolic signaling framework designed for representing, transmitting, and interpreting patient states across wellness and clinical systems.

It supports symbolic glyphs, rhythms, scalar intensities, and optional visual representations — all in a compact, protocol-compatible format.

---

## Use in Medical Practice

- Log affective states (e.g., stress, withdrawal, overstimulation)
- Track symbolic pulses (e.g., heart rhythm, sleep disturbance)
- Identify recurring state interruptions
- Represent non-verbalized needs via state glyphs

---

## Example: Patient Monitoring

### Observation:
> "The patient is agitated and unfocused."

### Glyph Detection:
> `glyph #22 = flooding (overstimulated)`
> `glyph #4 = depletion (no recovery pattern)`

### Action:
- Reduce environmental stimulus
- Introduce calming agent
- Log glyphs and continue monitoring

## Core Glyph Set (Initial)

| Glyph ID | Label        | Description               |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 4        | Depletion    | Low energy, recovery need |
| 11       | Grounding    | Stabilization, re-balance |
| 22       | Flooding     | Stimulation overload      |
| 15       | Clarity      | Lucid insight             |
| 73       | Stagnation   | Energy lock, mental loop  |
